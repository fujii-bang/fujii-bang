## About Me

I am a Computer Science student at Northeastern University with a strong background in software development and problem-solving. I have experience with object-oriented design projects in both **Java** and **Python**, as well as functional languages such as **OCaml**. I am interested in backend development, including **application design**, **data handling**, and **system optimization**. I enjoy working on projects that allow me to overcome challenges I have not faced so far. I am currently **seeking co-op opportunities** in **software engineering** where I can apply my knowledge and continue learning.
